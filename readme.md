# weather app
 
## Description

This is a weather application that takes a user inputted city and outputs the current conditions and a five day forecast. It also keeps track of search history in order to allow easy access to previously-viewed cities

## Installation

The contents of this repository are almost all ready to be hosted or used locally by the user, but styling relies on external Bootstrap and won't work without internet.

## Usage

To use this application, type the city you wish to search into the search bar and click the search button. It will then add your search term to a history section below the search bar, and put out AJAX requests to the OpenWeather API to retrieve current data for your searched location as well as a five day forecast. 

## Credits

Styling was made much easier by the wonderful bootstrap documentation available at (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

W3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/) was immensely helpful for learning and understanding JavaScript.

The jQuery library (https://jquery.com/) was extremely useful in building this application, and saved me many, many hours of busywork.

Weather data retrieved using the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api).

Special thanks to my instructors at the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, provided by Trinity Educational Services.
